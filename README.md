# üßÆ Calculator Project ‚Äì Zig (Shared)

üë• Shared with ALI CS Club

---

This is the **shared Zig calculator repository** for ALI CS Club members.  
It includes both:

- `cli/` ‚Äì A terminal-based calculator written in idiomatic Zig.  
- `gui/` ‚Äì A graphical calculator built using a Zig GUI library like `zgt` or `zgui`.

Each version is in its own folder and compiled using `zig build`.

## ü§ù Contribution Guidelines

- If you're working **independently**, please **fork** this repo or create a **branch**, and submit a **pull request** when your work is ready to merge.
- If you're working **together with a club member** (e.g., in a meeting), only **one person should edit and push at a time** to avoid conflicts.
- Keep code clean, idiomatic, and well-documented. Follow Zig conventions and place files in the correct folder (`cli/` or `gui/`).

## üß† Purpose

This project helps members learn and experiment with:

- Manual memory management and strong type safety in Zig (CLI version)
- GUI development using lightweight Zig libraries (GUI version)
- Modern low-level systems programming and GitHub collaboration

Happy hacking in Zig! ‚ö°
